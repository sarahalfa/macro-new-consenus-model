Macroeconomic Analysis AS2

New Consensus 3-equation model

IS Curve;
Phillips curve;
Interest rate rule;

1) Stimulate the model in R for 20 time periods using specific values outlined
2) Present a negative aggregate demand shock, at period t=5, with A declined from 1.1 to 1.09
3) Present 3 graphs to show the evolution of the inflation rate, the interest rate and output over the 20 periods of the simulation. Explain the economic mechanisms behind the changes and the evolution of the 3 variables caused by the demand shock. 

*note to self: R code accounts for 750 words + 30% of final mark
