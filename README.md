Macroeconomic Analysis AS2

Consider the following New Consensus 3-equation model:
IS Curve: Yt=A-yrt-1
Phillips Curve: πt=πt-1+a(yt-ye)
Interest rate rule: rt=A-ye/Y+aB(πt-πT)/y(1+a^2B)

where t denotes time, y is output, ye is the equilibrium output, π is the inflation rate, πT is the inlfation target, r is the real interest rate and A,a,B and y are parameteres

*note to self: input actual equations w correct formatting

Stimulate this model in R for 20 time periods using the following values:

A=1.1
a=B=1
y=2
πT=0.02
Ye=1
Y1=1=Ye
πt=1=πT
rt=1=A-ye/Y

Suppose that in period t=5, a permanent negative aggregate demand shock takes place. This shock is captured by a decline in A from 1.1 to 1.09.

Present 3 graphs that show the evolution of the inflation rate, the interest rate and output over the 20 periods of your simulation. Explain the economic mechanisms behind the change in the evolution of the 3 variables caused by the demand shock.
